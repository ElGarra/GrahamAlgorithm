# GrahamAlgorithm

## Program developed for Algorithm Design - MIE Electif of École Centrale de Marseille	by Joaquín Castaños, to find and create a chart of the convex Hull of a random set of points.

Based on GeekForGeeks python3 [program to find convex hull of a set of points](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-2-graham-scan/). Refer [GeekForGeeks orientation function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/orientation-3-ordered-points/) for explanation of orientation()
