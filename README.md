# GrahamAlgorithm

 Program developed for Algorithm Design - MIE Electif of École Centrale de Marseille	by Joaquín Castaños, to find and create a chart of the convex Hull of a random set of points.

## Set up the program

0. First of all, It's recommended to create a virtual enviroment. You can do it using python ´´´venv´´´ library. Go to the root folder of this repository and run the following commands:

1. Create the virtual enviroment:
´´´
python3 -m venv virtualenv # Create a virtual enviroment called virtualenv
´´´

2. activate the virtual enviroment:
´´´
source virtualenv/bin/activate
´´´

3. Install dependencies:
´´´
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install in the virtual enviroment all the dependencies listed on requirements.txt file
´´´

4. If you want to deactivate the virtual enviroment after use the programme:
´´´
deactivate
´´´

## Run the programme

´´´
python3 main.py
´´´
